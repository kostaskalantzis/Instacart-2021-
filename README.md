# Instacart-2021
My name is Konstantinos Kalantzis and i created this notebook as an assignment for a course that i attended as a student of the University of Macedonia.
In this assingnment i took data from the company Instacart and used them to create a predictive model in order to better predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order.
